Wild West (GoDaddy Reseller) PHP API 
=============

This library connects to GoDaddy's Wild West Reseller SOAP API 
using PHP's built-in SOAP functionality. Previously, this library required 
Zend Framework. This is no longer the case.

Certification Scripts
-------

If you have a Wild West account -I assume you do- you're familiar with the 
headache that is OTE Certification. In this project you will find a wizard to
complete this for you. Simply place the entire project directory on your 
server, access the "certifications" directory, entery your OTE credentials, 
and voila you're done.


API Examples
-------

The easiest way to understand how to use this library is to 
examine the PHP files under certifications/tests/. While 
these are for the OTE certification, together they outline 
the basic operations available in the API.
